# Weclome
First of all thanks for taking the time to read this and for your interest in contributing to Automatiko - very welcome!!!

# How to contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to the project. It certainly does not mean you must contribute code (though it's more than welcome:)).

Let's have a look at various options...

## Try it

The easiest and usually the first thing is to try out the project, its examples and documentation. While you're on this don't forget
to give a word or two about the impression and pain poitns you have run into. Providing feedback is very important to improve so 
others won't have the same issues you had.

## Report problems

In case you found problems while trying it please make the effort to report the problem as an issue. Ideally with reproducer (a simple project
that illustrates the problem) or steps to reproduce. If the problem is reproducable with either examples or the test suite feel free to made
modifications that reproduce the problem as Pull Request (aka PR).

## Spread the word

It might sound silly but one of the most valuable contribution is spreading the word about the project. That includes

- talking about it on user groups and various events
- mentioning on twitter
- blogging about the project
- writting articles about the project

It does not have to be extensive as sometimes just bringing the project to someone's attention can bring a lot of value to the project.

## Share your ideas

Share your ideas about project usage, features, future and more. We are open community that encourages discussions to move the project forward.

## Write examples

If you have an interesting use case in mind that you've been working on then maybe it could become an example that others can quickly try.
This is not only helping the project to reach different areas but helping community to place the project in thier domain.

## Help on documentation

Documentation in many cases is left behind but at the same time it is one of the most demanded reasource of the project. We do try to document
the most important aspects of the project so helping with that is of great value. Sometimes by reading the documentation you will find typos,
missing information etc an easy start would be to submit a PR for these small yet valueable updates.

## Work on the code

Last but not least is the code contribution which requires some understanding about the internals but the more you use it the more you learn 
so don't be afraid and jump on it :) We are here to help so don't hesitate to reach out via mailing list or twitter.
